## Remaining Unmerged Themes in PR #68

The draft still contains broad refactors and API behavior changes that were not merged to `main`:

1. Large execution/runtime refactors (`TaskLifecycle`, `TimeoutBudget`, `AsyncRef` struct migration)
2. Workflow/Req/Weather timeout-budget propagation changes
3. Telemetry metadata sanitization behavior changes
4. Broad test-suite rewrites and coverage-only churn
5. Cross-cutting API/return-shape normalization beyond focused merged fixes

## Decomposition Policy

Do not merge PR #68 as a single unit. Continue with narrowly scoped PRs that:

1. isolate one behavior change per PR,
2. include targeted regression tests for that behavior,
3. document compatibility impacts explicitly,
4. avoid unrelated test churn.

## Candidate Future Slices (if still desired)

1. Telemetry metadata sanitization as opt-in behavior.
2. Timeout-budget propagation for workflow/request/weather paths.
3. AsyncRef struct migration with explicit compatibility/deprecation window.

## Disposition

Treat PR #68 as historical context only. Once required slices are extracted into focused PRs/issues, close PR #68.
