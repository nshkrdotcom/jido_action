# Jido.Exec

Execution engine contracts for synchronous, asynchronous, and policy-aware action runs.

## Intent

Describe the execution semantics that sit between authored actions and runtime policy.

```spec-meta
id: jido_action.exec
kind: workflow
status: active
summary: Execution engine for action normalization, retries, timeouts, cancellation, compensation, sanitized telemetry, and instance-scoped supervision.
surface:
  - lib/jido_action/application.ex
  - lib/jido_action/runtime.ex
  - lib/jido_action/exec.ex
  - lib/jido_action/exec/*.ex
  - guides/configuration.md
  - guides/execution-engine.md
  - guides/testing.md
  - test/jido_action/exec*_test.exs
  - test/jido_action/exec/*.exs
decisions:
  - jido_action.spec_migration
  - jido_action.execution_logging_hygiene
```

## Requirements

```spec-requirements
- id: jido_action.exec.sync_async_engine
  statement: Jido.Exec shall normalize params and context, execute actions synchronously or asynchronously, and preserve action metadata in the runtime context it passes to actions.
  priority: must
  stability: stable

- id: jido_action.exec.reliability_controls
  statement: The execution engine shall apply retries, timeout handling, cancellation cleanup, compensation, sanitized telemetry, and instance-scoped supervisor/config behavior where those policies are configured.
  priority: must
  stability: stable

- id: jido_action.exec.error_result_normalization
  statement: When an action returns `{:error, reason}` without an exception struct, Jido.Exec shall return an `ExecutionFailureError` with a string message and preserve structured map details for downstream handling.
  priority: must
  stability: stable

- id: jido_action.exec.logging_hygiene
  statement: Execution logging shall sanitize inspected runtime values, keep routine start and success traces behind an explicit debug-level opt-in, and preserve warning or error visibility for invalid configuration and runtime failures.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving
```
